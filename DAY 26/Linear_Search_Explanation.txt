1)Linear search is a sequential searching algorithm where we start from one end and check every element of the list until the desired element is found. 
It is the simplest searching algorithm.

2)How Linear Search Works?

The following steps are followed to search for an element k = 1 in the list below.
Initial array
Array to be searched for
Start from the first element, compare k with each element x.
Element not found
Compare with each element
If x == k, return the index.
Element found
Else, return not found.


3)Linear Search Algorithm

LinearSearch(array, key)
  for each item in the array
    if item == value
      return its index
      
4)Linear Search Complexities
Time Complexity: O(n)
Space Complexity: O(1)
