PROBLEM : We Perform Method overloading by changing the type of an argument 

SOLUTION 
In Java, two or more methods may have the same name if they differ in parameters (different number of parameters, different types of parameters, or both).
These methods are called overloaded methods and this feature is called method overloading.

Two or more methods can have the same name inside the same class if they accept different arguments.
This feature is known as method overloading.

we have created two methods that differs in data type.
The first add method receives two integer arguments and second add method receives two double arguments.

We can give different primitive datatype to differentiate between the methods 

like int, float, double etc
