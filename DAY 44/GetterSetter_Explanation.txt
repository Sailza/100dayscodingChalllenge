PROBLEM  - TO SHOW THE WORKING FEATURE OF GETTER AND SETTER IN JAVA 

SOLUTION  
Getter and setter methods in Java are widely used to access and manipulate the values of class fields. Usually,
class fields are decorated with a private access specifier.
Thus, to access them, public access specifiers are used with the getter and setter methods.

- The getter method returns the value of the attribute.
- The setter method takes a parameter and assigns it to the attribute.

Getters and setters are used to protect your data, particularly when creating classes.
For each instance variable, a getter method returns its value while a setter method sets or updates its value.
Given this, getters and setters are also known as accessors and mutators, respectively

IN OUR CODE WE CREATE A EMPLOYEE CLASS AND TAKE EMPLOYEE ID, NAME, DESIGNATION, COMPANY AS GETTER AND SET THE VALUES OF THESE BY SETTER FUNCTION
