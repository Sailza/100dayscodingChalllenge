PROBLEM : To convert the lower data type into higher data type in java language 

SOLUTION 
Type casting
Convert a value from one data type to another data type is known as type casting.
When we have to convert from lower data type to higher data type we use Widening Type Casting

Converting a lower data type into a higher one is called widening type casting.
It is also known as implicit conversion or casting down. It is done automatically.
It is safe because there is no chance to lose data. 

It takes place when:
1)Both data types must be compatible with each other.
2)The target type must be larger than the source type.
byte -> short -> char -> int -> long -> float -> double  

the conversion between numeric data type to char or Boolean is not done automatically.
Also, the char and Boolean data types are not compatible with each other
