class Sample
{

// THE OUTPUT OF THIS PROGRAM IS : THIS IS FIRST JAVA PROGRAM 
//EXPLANATION OF THIS CODE

IN LINE 1: HERE WE create a class named Sample
line 3: public static void main(String args[]) =  this is default function present in every java program 
here public is access modifier with the help of public we can acess the member function within the program 
the static keyword is a non access modifiers used for methods and attributes 
static methods/attributres can be accessed without creating an object of a class
void show that after the execution of a program it will not return  any value 
String args is an array of string type 

line7: to display  the output in java we use System.out.println
