PROBLEM  : TO CALCULATE THE AVERAGE AND SUM OF ELEMENTS STORED IN ARRAY 
SOLUTION : THIS PROBLEM IS VERY SIMPLE , I USE FOR EACH LOOP IN JAVA LANGUAGE TO SOLVE THIS PROBLEM 

POSSIBLE TEST CASES 
TEST CASE 1 : 
IF GIVEN ARRAY IS EMPTY

SAMPLE INPUT 
Int [] numbers  ={ } 

SAMPLE OUTPUT 
SUM = 0 
AVG = 0 

TEST CASE 2 :
IF IT CONTAINS COMBINATION OF POSITIVE , NEGATIVE AND ZERO 

SO IN CASE OF SUM OF NUMBERS IT WILL PRINT INTEGER VALUE 
BUT 
IN CASE OF AVERAGE IT PRINT DECIMAL VALUE 
SO I TAKE AVERAGE AS DOUBLE 

SAMPLE INPUT 
Int [] numbers  ={ 0,4,1.3,-2} 

SAMPLE OUTPUT 
SUM = 3.3
avg = 0.825


EXPLANATION 

HERE I USE THE CONCEPT OF FOR EACH LOOP 
For-each is another array traversing technique like for loop, while loop, do-while loop introduced in Java 
It starts with the keyword for like a normal for-loop.
Instead of declaring and initializing a loop counter variable, you declare a variable that is the same type as the base type of the array, followed by a colon, which is then followed by the array name.
In the loop body, you can use the loop variable you created rather than using an indexed array element. 
Itâ€™s commonly used to iterate over an array or a Collections class (eg, ArrayList)


SYNTAX 
for (type var : array) 
{ 
    statements using var;
}


CODE 
public class Main {

 public static void main(String[] args) {

  int[] numbers = {2, -9, 0, 5, 12, -25, 22, 9, 8, 12};
   int sum = 0;
   Double average;
   
   for (int number: numbers) {
     sum += number;
   }
   
   int arrayLength = numbers.length;
   average =  ((double)sum / (double)arrayLength);
   System.out.println("Sum of array elements  = " + sum);
   System.out.println("Average of array elements  = " + average);
 }
}


OUTPUT 
Sum of array elements  = 36
Average of array elements  = 3.6
