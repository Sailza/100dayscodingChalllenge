PROBLEM - DISPLAY THE SUM OF ALL DIGITS  DIGITS 
SOLUTION- THIS PROBLEM IS VERY SIMPLE , WE CAN SOLVE THIS PROBLEM BY USING WHILE LOOP IN JAVA LANGUAGE 

SAMPLE OUTPUT 

First iteration

674 % 10 = 4

Sum = 0 + 4 = 4

674 / 10 = 67

Second iteration

67 % 10 = 7

Sum = 4 + 7 = 11

67 / 10 = 6
Third iteration

6 % 10 = 6

Sum = 11 + 6 = 17

6 / 10 = 0
Now the number (N) has become 0. So, we will not process it further. Hence, we get 17 as the sum of digits of the number 674.
