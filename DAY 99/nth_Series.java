PROBLEM : Consider the following series: 1,1,2,3,4,9,8,27,16,81,32,243,64,729,128,2187…

This series is a mixture of 2 series – all the odd terms in this series form a geometric series and all the even terms form yet another geometric series. 
Write a program to find the Nth term in the series.

The value N in a positive integer that should be read from STDIN. The Nth term that is calculated by the program should be written to STDOUT. 
Other than value of n th term,no other character / string or message should be written to STDOUT. For example , if N=16, the 16th term in the series is 2187,
so only value 2187 should be printed to STDOUT.


SOLUTION 
CODE 
import java.util.Scanner;
class series2
{
	public static void main(String[] args)
	{
		Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
		//input value of n
		System.out.print("Enter the value of n : ");				
		int n = sc.nextInt();
		int a = 1, b = 1;
		//statement for even value of n
		if(n % 2 == 0)
		{
			for(int i = 1 ; i <= (n-2) ; i = i+2)
			{
				a = a * 2;
				b = b * 3;
			}
			System.out.print(n+" element of the series is = "+b);
		}
		//statement for odd value of n
		else
		{
			for(int i = 1 ; i < (n-2) ; i = i+2)
			{
				a = a * 2;
				b = b * 3;
			}
			a = a * 2;
			System.out.print(n+" element of the series is = "+a);
		}
	}
}

OUTPUT 
Enter the value of n : 14
14 element of the series is = 729
