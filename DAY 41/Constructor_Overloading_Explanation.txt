PROBLEM : To Show the working of Constructor Overloading  

EXPLANATION 
In Java, we can overload constructors like methods. 
The constructor overloading can be defined as the concept of having more than one constructor with different parameters 
So, that every constructor can perform a different task
In the code the Student class constructor
is overloaded with two different constructors, I.e., default and parameterized
 Sometimes, we need to use multiple constructors to initialize the different values of the class.

We must also notice that the java compiler invokes a default constructor when we do not use any constructor in the class.
However, the default constructor is not invoked if we have used any constructor in the class, whether it is default or parameterized.
In this case, the java compiler throws an exception saying the constructor is undefined.
