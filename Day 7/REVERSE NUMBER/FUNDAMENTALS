                                                       JAVA WHILE LOOP 


Java while loop is a control flow statement that allows code to be executed repeatedly based on a given Boolean condition. 
The while loop can be thought of as a repeating if statement. While loop in Java comes into use when we need to repeatedly execute a block of statements. 
The while loop is considered as a repeating if statement. 
If the number of iterations is not fixed, it is recommended to use the while loop.


Syntax:
while (test_expression)
{
   // statements
 
  update_expression;
}



THE VARIOUS PART OF WHILE LOOP ARE :- 

1. Test Expression: In this expression, we have to test the condition.
If the condition evaluates to true then we will execute the body of the loop and go to update expression. Otherwise, we will exit from the while loop. 

2. 2. Update Expression: After executing the loop body, this expression increments/decrements the loop variable by some value.



WHILE LOOP EXAMPLE 

class whileLoopDemo {
	public static void main(String args[])
	{
		int i = 1;
		while (i < 6) {
			System.out.println("Hello World");

			i++;
		}
	}
}

OUTPUT 
Hello World
Hello World
Hello World
Hello World
Hello World

  
  
  
  
                                                     JAVA IF-ELSE STATEMENT 

Decision Making in Java helps to write decision-driven statements and execute a particular set of code based on certain conditions.
The if statement alone tells us that if a condition is true it will execute a block of statements and if the condition is false it wonâ€™t.
But what if we want to do something else if the condition is false. 
Here comes the else statement.
We can use the else statement with the if statement to execute a block of code when the condition is false.


SYNTAX :
if (condition)
{
    // Executes this block if
    // condition is true
}
else
{
    // Executes this block if
    // condition is false
}



EXAMPLE OF IF-ELSE 

class IfElse {
	public static void main(String args[])
	{
		int i = 20;

		if (i < 15)
			System.out.println("i is smaller than 15");
		else
			System.out.println("i is greater than 15");

		System.out.println("Outside if-else block");
	}
}

OUTPUT 
i is greater than 15
Outside if-else block
