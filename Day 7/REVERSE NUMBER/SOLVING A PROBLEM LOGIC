PROBLEM - TO REVERSE THE GIVEN NUMBER BY TAKING INPUT FROM USER 


THIS PROBLEM IS VERY SIMPLE , THE METHOD I USED TO SOLVE THIS PROBLEM IS 
I  SOLVED THIS PROBLEM BY USING WHILE LOOP AND IF- ELSE STATEMENT IN JAVA LANGUAGE 


EXPLANATION OF TOPIC 
Reversing a number means that the digit at the first position should be swapped with the last digit, 
the second digit will be swapped with the second last digit, and so on till the middle element. 

 
POSSIBLE TEST CASES ARE 
1) TO CHECK WEATHER THE VALUE NOT EQUAL TO NULL 

2) IF REVERSE OF THE NUMBER IS SAME , i.e THE GIVEN NUMBER IS PALINDROME 
ENTER THE VALUE 
12221 
REVERSE IS 
12221 
SO THIS CONDITION IS PALINDROME CONDITION 

3)IF GIVEN NUMBER IS NOT PALINDROME , THEN DISPLAY THE REVERSE OF NUMBER 
ENTER THE VALUE 
12345
REVERSE IS 
54321
SO THIS IS NOT PALINDROME , SO IT REVERSE THE VALUE
