PROBLEM : TO FIND THE AREA AND PERIMETER OF RECTANGLE BY CREATING THE CLASS 

SOLUTION 
we have declared two classes: 
Rectangle and Rectdemo . 
The Rectangle class contains two fields length and breadth of type int that correspond to the length and breadth of the rectangle respectively. 
In addition, the Rectangle class also contains two methods named setData () and area ().
The method setData () initializes length and breadth fields of an object and area ()calculates the area of the rectangle. 
It does not have a main () method and therefore cannot be run. It is merely a definition used to define and create Rectangle objects. 
So we define another class named Rectdemo  that contains the main () method from where the program execution actually begins.

FOR AREA OF RECTANGLE 
we create a area method and calculate  area as lenght * breadth

FOR PERIMETER OF RECTANGLE 
we create a perimeter method and perform 2*(lenght+breadth)

In the main (), the statement
Rectangle rect = new Rectangle();
reates a Rectangle object in memory and assign it to the reference variable firstRect
after that we call area and perimeter method
