PROBLEM : By using throw keyword handle the Exception handling in java 

SOLUTION 
In Java, exceptions allows us to write good quality codes where the errors are checked at the compile time instead of runtime 
and we can create custom exceptions making the code recovery and debugging easier.
Java throw keyword
The Java throw keyword is used to throw an exception explicitly.
We specify the exception object which is to be thrown. 
The Exception has some message with it that provides the error description. 
These exceptions may be related to user inputs, server, etc.
We can throw either checked or unchecked exceptions in Java by throw keyword.
It is mainly used to throw a custom exception.
