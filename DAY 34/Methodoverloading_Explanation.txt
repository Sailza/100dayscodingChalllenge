PROBLEM: To show Method Overloading in java language 

SOLUTION EXPLANATION :

In Java, two or more methods may have the same name if they differ in parameters (different number of parameters, different types of parameters, or both).
These methods are called overloaded methods and this feature is called method overloading.

Two or more methods can have the same name inside the same class if they accept different arguments.
This feature is known as method overloading.
Method overloading is achieved by either:

1)changing the number of arguments.
2)or changing the data type of arguments.
It is not method overloading if we only change the return type of methods.
There must be differences in the number of parameters.

In this program we are performing method overloading by changing the number of arguments.
